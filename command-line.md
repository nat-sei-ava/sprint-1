The command line is another way to tell your computer what you want it to do!
Instead of using a mouse, windows or buttons you type text commands.  

I don't think it's very user friendly for visual people as it requires you to
know the commands by heart.  With my limited experience using the command line
I've found with repeated repetition it gets a little easier
